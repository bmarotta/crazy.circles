# Crazy Circles
 
Crazy Circles is a visual illusion which happens when different balls bouncing inside of a circle create the impression of a circular movement, where in reality, the movement of each ball is straight.

The CrazyCircles javascript class allows you to easily add this nice visual effect to your loading...'s page.
